# Projects
These projects are a culmination of the projects I have worked on.

The projects are made during my time in college and during spare time.

Here is what each project does:
-
- Darwin: A simulation of ants in an environment that navigate and cooperate to find food sources using our own custom Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm
- ML Algorithms: Around 4 files with machine learning algorithms that were made from scratch. Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, SGD on Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression
- StockTrackingML: This is a project where we used LSTM and Random Forest ML models to predict stock prices from some of the top tech companies including Apple and Google. TensorFlow was used to run the ML models.
- BlackJackAI: We made a Black Jack AI that could compete for a higher win rate. We had two different AIs that used different methods to win. The first used a Monte Carlo game tree and the second we used a simple regression model.
