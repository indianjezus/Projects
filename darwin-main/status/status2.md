1. **Recap:**
   1. Our plan has shifted a bit over the last three weeks. Originally our plan was to continue with the idea of making a simulation where you can see creatures (made by us) interacting with an environment and other species of creatures. But after talking to Lars, we’ve realized that the scope of our project may be unrealistic, so we’re going to meet soon to discuss a single focus for our project. Whether this be a model for a genome, a pathfinding AI algorithm, or a creature interaction simulator. This was a recent conversation that was had so we plan on meeting soon to figure out our new scope and update our intermediate planning document.
1. **Tasks Completed:**
   1. All group members have been actively meeting and discussing the aspects of our project.
   1. We’ve all contributed to the planning and status documents, as well as doing research on projects similar to the one we’re doing.
   1. We’ve also all began to start to familiarize ourselves with GoDot by downloading it and becoming familiar the UI layout.
   1. We’ve started started mapping out each individual part of the project.
1. **Successes:**
   1. I think we’ve realized, after talking with Lars, where we were going wrong. And in lieu of this have made the realization that our current scope is unachievable by April, so we’re planning on narrowing it down to a specific part of the project and adding the other parts as stretch goals. We’ve also agreed on using GoDot to make our project and have agreed on how to divide up the work.
   1. We tried to completely map out all the logistics of our previous project scope and thought it was doable, but after talking with Lars, we realized that the logistics we came up with were still very basic and the deeper we dove into what it would entail to complete it, the more unreasonable it became.
1. **Roadblocks/Challenges:**
   1. I think our biggest challenge was figuring out how our original plan would actually look in code/practice. We’ve also struggled with coming to an agreement on what we specifically want to do and how we want to go about doing it. We agree on project idea, just disagree on how it should be done.
   1. We’re still trying to narrow our scope down, and we hope to have it figured out by next week (12/8). And we have come to agreements on many of the things we were disagreeing about.
   1. I think we did need help, but Lars helped us figure out what we need to do and we plan on taking his advise.
1. **Changes/Deviations from Pitch:**
   1. I think our main change is currently in progress. We are going to change the scope of our project to focus it on one element of our original scope. This will allow us to for sure deliver a project that works.
1. **Confidence:**
   1. Zakk (4), Austin(5), Vihan(4). AVG = 4.3
1. **Group Dynamics:**
   1. I think our dynamics are good because although we do disagree on specifics, I think this helps us in the long run because we’re figuring out the best way to go about achieving this project. We’re also consistently meeting every week and actively discussing the project when we do meet.
