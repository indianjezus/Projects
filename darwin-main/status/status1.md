Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks:
  The last 3 weeks consisted of us finding a scope for our project. Our aim was to narrow it down where there was a good difficulty, but also wasn't hard to complete by August. We also   discussed the primary contents our project would have. We had four meetings to discuss this.
Tasks completed
  We met. We gave our project a base scope. We also discussed the primary contents our project will have and how our UI would work. 
Description of tasks completed (and by whom)
  All group members participated and engaged in discussions for meetings. The tasks were primarily planning based so equal discussion was seen amongst the group members.
Successes
  Coming up with a proper plan and direction that our project would go.
What were you group accomplishments?
  Agreeing on a plan for our project.
Were there other things you tried that did not work and why?
  Not necessarily considering all tasks were planning-based.
Roadblocks/challenges
  Coming to an agreement from all group members on how we would approach the project and what the scope would be.
Describe the challenges
  Austin and Vihan had differing opinions on the language we wanted to use as well as how we wanted to approach making genomes and what they would do on our interactive enviornment.
Did you overcome them or are there still challenges left?
  We did manage to overcome them.
Do you need help with it?  Can your mentor help or do you need external help?
  We will need our mentor to see if our project scope and contents are addequate as well as questions on what game engine and language are best to approaching it.
Changes/Deviations from the project Pitch
  As of now not necessarily.
