Status Update 5

Zakk Loveall, Vihan Garg, Austin Barner

1. **Recap:**
   1. We’ve essentially been planning our stretch goals over the last 3 weeks at this point. Our plan to finish our deliverable is pretty set in stone and is nearly complete so we’re focusing on plans for stretch goals in case time allows for it.
1. **Tasks Done:**
   1. Zakk and Vihan have been focusing on getting our ant colony pathfinding algorithm implemented. They’ve nearly completed implementing this algorithm. There are couple bugs we still need to work out, but we’ve got all the logic for it implemented. Austin has been focusing on efficiency. Specifically making our simulation run better and look nicer.
   1. We’ve met 5 times to work and plan over the last three weeks. And we’ve done ~30 hours of programming between all of us over that time. This has come out to be ~400 lines of code.
1. **Successes:**
   1. Our accomplishments include getting the logic for the pathfinding algorithm worked out and implemented. As well as being able to make our program run way more efficiently.
   1. Scaling back on algorithm was a good choice because originally we were going to use machine learning techniques coupled with the pathfinding algorithm. Focusing more on the algorithm itself has helped a lot.
   1. We tried a couple different ways of implementing our ant colony pathfinding algorithm that didn’t work. And they didn’t work because they had limitations that prevented them from working with our method of traversal.
1. **Roadblocks:**
   1. Our main roadblock was getting the logic for the pathfinding algorithm figured out. As well as the tilemap implementation, which made our program more efficient.
   1. We overcame them by trial and error. We tried a couple different methods of implementing both of these features, and as we tried to implement, we figured out what worked and what didn’t.
   1. We still need to work out a couple small bugs regarding how we setup our hierarchy in Unity that’s preventing the pathfinding from fully working.
   1. We mostly just need help with finalizing our project (making sure it’s presentable).
1. **Changes:**
   1. We haven’t deviated from our previous update. The only change that’s been solidified is the ant colony movement algorithm that we’re using.
1. **Details/Goals:**
   1. Over the next three weeks we’re going to finish implementing our logic for the pathfinding and clean up for presentation. 
1. **Confidence:**
   1. Zakk: 5, Vihan: 5, Austin: 5
