1. Recap:
   1. Over the last three weeks, we’ve essentially just been planning how to do our presentation. This has involved splitting up our presentation into pieces that each of us can take when we present. Also finalizing all the information on the slides.
1. Tasks Completed:
   1. Finished our Presentation - All of us
   1. Debugging the code - All of us
   1. Cleaning up the UI - All of us
   1. We’ve spent ~25 hours working on all of this throughout the past 3 weeks
1. Successes:
   1. We got what we think is very nice presentation along with a working project. We’ve overcome a lot of the challenges we were facing in previous weeks.
   1. Our main solutions that have been successful at this point have been going to Lars to see how we need to improve our presentation. We also have been messing with the pheromone logic of our project to try to make slight improvements.
   1. We tried to do our presentation before fixing some errors with our project but we realized that this would’ve created a bad representation of our project.
1. Roadblocks/Challenges:
   1. Our main challenge has been crafting a good presentation that can represent what we did in just a handful of slides. Organizing it has been tough as well because we want it to flow well.
   1. We overcame this by getting advice from Lars and other peers. We did a lot of reflection of how it should be organized as well.
   1. We still need to get a working video of our project on our presentation.
   1. We just need help making sure we have the best presentation we can at the point. Our mentor can help by giving us more advice next wednesday.
1. Changes:
   1. We haven’t made any noteworthy changes from our original plan. Some small debugging has changed some of our logic, but overall, we still have the same project.
1. Plan:
   1. Our main goal for the next three weeks is to go give a great presentation on April 20th of our 8 month long project. We would love to take this project further by turning it into a life simulation game or a tower defense game.
1. Confidence:
   1. Zakk - 5, Vihan - 5, Austin - 5, AVG = 5.
