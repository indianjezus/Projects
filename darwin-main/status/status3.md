Status Update 3

1. Recap:
  - The last three weeks we've planned out quite a lot. We've started by planning out exactly how to transfer Austin's code from Java to C#. We have also mapped the layout of how our agents will traverse the terrain by deciding how to handle tilemaps. We're also slowly realizing that we may finish this project much quicker than anticipated, so we're going to plan on expanding out our stretch goals in order to have a good idea of how to smoothly integrate them with our current project.
2. Tasks Completed:
  - Austin found some perlin noise libraries in Unity that will work to generate our terrain so we don't have to code that manually (~4 hours).
  - Zakk created a .gitignore file that will ignore all the extra files that come with a Unity project, so we can feasibly set up an environment for Unity in GitHub (~2 hours).
  - Vihan has found good software that he can use to create the art we need for this project. He spent some time experimenting with and learning the software (~2 hours).
3. Successes:
  - We managed to successfully get the libraries we need to complete the project in Unity. We also have successfully set up a test GitHub repo that works with Unity so we can move our work to the official repo. We also figured out that many of these libraries will take care of a lot of the manual coding done by Austin in Java so this will clean up things quite a lot.
  - Switching to Unity was a very successful solution to a big problem we had with GoDot. Our splitting of tasks for this set of weeks worked really well. As well as our starting attempts to transfer code to C#.
  - We tried to use GoDot for simplicity sake but it actually ended up making our project significantly more complicated to implement. We also tried to plan set meeting times during the week but realized that we can only really meet on weekends.
4. Roadblocks/Challenges:
  - Our first challenge was starting the project. We needed to each learn how to use GoDot, which posed a challenge. We also needed to find the libraries supported by GoDot in order to get our project working.
  - We mainly overcame both of these issues by switching to Unity for this project. We've all worked with Unity before so there's no longer a learning curve to understanding the software and Unity itself supports the libraries we need to make the project work.
  - We still need to figure out how we're going to set up a tile map that our agent can traverse. We have a few options that we are going to try and we'll pick the best one. We also still need to figure out the most efficient way to get a good heuristic function implemented in Unity.
  - We mostly just need help dividing up work at this point. We're starting to realize that there's going to be a lot of waiting for people to finish tasks.
5. Changes/Deviations:
  - We're using Unity to build our project instead of GoDot now.
6. Details of Goals:
  - Tweak terrain to ensure we get the best result each generation cycle.
  - Get tile map picked out and implemented over our generated terrain.
  - Start getting an agent moving around the terrain based on some basic heuristic.
  - Have a start menu created that will control the game
  - Map out stretch goals in detail in case we finish everything.
  - We think that if we finish everything we have planned in the deliverable, we can reasonably get a natural selection based system going where our agents will get rewards/punishments for making good or bad decisions. We can potentially add more complex behavior to our terrain environment.
7. Confidence:
  - Austin: 4
  - Zakk: 4
  - Vihan: 4
  - AVG: 4
