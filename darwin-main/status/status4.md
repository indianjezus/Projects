1. Recap

These last 3 weeks have seen a lot of setup progression, but progression to our actual project has been quite limited. We have worked on setting up a way to collaborate and share files to work on the project. There has been development on the concept art for the project. 

1. Tasks Completed

- Austin has successfully invited Zakk and I to the Unity project. 
- Vihan has worked on making concept art for the tiles and organisms.
- Zakk and Vihan have started working on researching pathfinding and genetic learning algorithms to implement. 

1. Successes

Since this week most of our work has been in regards to collaboration and setup, our successes have been quite limited. We are now able to effectively collaborate and share ideas on the same project which has been good. We have also got some of the concept art done. We tried setting up a GitHub to collaborate, however, that has not been quite successful. 

1. Roadblocks/Challenges

The only notable challenge was trying to setup a way for us to effectively code on the same project and push changes. As mentioned earlier, our biggest problem was trying to setup a GitHub, however, we were able to overcome the challenge by using Unity’s collaboration tools to code on the same project. Currently, there are no problems that we are facing but that will very likely change when we start implementing or AI algorithms. There isn’t anything particular we can think of that our advisor can assist us with. 

1. Changes/Deviation

Instead of using GitHub we are now using Unity’s collaboration tools to work on the project together. 



1. Plan for Next 3 weeks

The plan for the next 3 weeks will be as follows. For starters, we will finish researching which algorithms we are going to use as well as how we aim to implement them. We will also start implementing those algorithms and start the coding/debugging process for that. We will also work on getting the start menu created as well as heuristics and a reward system for our search algorithm. Vihan will finish up the art for the tiles and the organism and work on making the rest of the environment visually pleasing.
