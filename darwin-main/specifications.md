Instructions for Using Darwin Simulation:

1.  Install Unity and Unity Hub with version 2021.3.16f1. This version is required for the project to work properly.

2.  Next, download the ‘Senior Design’ folder in our repository. This older contains the main contents of our project.

3.  Next open Unity Hub and click the button in the top right that says 'Add'. Then click 'add project from disk'.

4.  Locate the folder downloaded from our repo and add this folder to our Unity Hub. Wait for it to be added, this may take a while.

5.  After the project has been loaded, you can click the play button in he top middle of the screen and watch the ants navigate through he terrain.

6.  If you want a different terrain or want to increase/decrease how any ants there are, you can click on the ‘main camera’ on the left side of the screen. This will bring up a list of settings on the right side of the screen where you can change the ‘seed’ option to change the terrain. Set it to -1 if you want the seed to be completely random. Change the ‘Max Creatures’ option to change how many creatures are on the screen. The other settings are fairly arbitrary, however, feel free to mess around with them to mess with the terrain to create unique behavior patterns!
