Retrospective

1. What went well?:
   1. We’re all really excited about doing this project, and all have the capabilities to get it done. We are 85% confident we can get it done and we are all getting along quite well even if our ideas clash at times. We are all on the same page about what we’re doing and how we’re going to go about doing it. We’re also meeting very consistently and making a lot of progress in the meetings we have.
1. What didn’t go so well?:
   1. Our main idea was the same, but we disagreed on how we were going to go about achieving this idea. It took us some time to get on the same page, and we felt like we were falling behind at a point (we’re good now). We also received a very low score on our intermediate planning document, which made us realize how bad our initial idea was in regards to the specifics of it.
1. What have we learned?:
   1. I think we all learned that it’s really hard to agree on how to go about executing an idea, especially regarding the specifics of it. Which is where we learned that when planning out an idea we really need to think every single last aspect of it through before executing the idea. We also learned that we were being way too ambitious so we’ve significantly narrowed down our scope to something that is definitely achievable with enough hard work. We also learned how much time/effort it takes to plan something out on this scale.
1. What issues still?:
   1. Our only current two issues are coming up with a good heuristic function that will allow the agent to work with Austin’s terrain code. And the process to go about transferring that code from Java to C#. Other than that, I think our meetings with Lars have hopefully solved a lot of our problems.
1. Recommendations:
   1. I think we all really liked the layout of the class, and how it occurred every two or so weeks. We also think the mandatory meetings with the mentors were extremely helpful. And we also liked the layout of the assignments. Each assignment felt like it had a purpose and required us to think our project through.
   1. We think the only aspect of the class that could be changed is the use of GitHub. We think GitHub was a great option for organizing our documents, but allowing for more options (specifically for this stage of the class), such as Google Drive or some cloud service, would be nice.
